# bash_history_timestamp

Adds timestamp logging to specified users' ~/.bash_profile.

## Usage
`history` should return bash history with timestamp.  You can configure the way the timestamp is formatted in the attributes file.

## Testing
You can add additional OS/boxes to .kitchen.yml and run `kitchen test`.  I have only tested this on CentOS 6.5 and Ubuntu 12.04
